COST AND AGE:

The Calculator we know today were first invented in the 1960’s. The use of smart
phones as calculator began in 1990’s.

Several computing machines were made long before the arrival of digital
calculator’s and smart phones. The abacus, for example, was used in the ancient
near East, Europe, Russia, and China long before the adoption of the written
Hindu-Arabic numeric system.

The Hewlett-Packard 9100A is an early programming calculator, first appearing in

    HP called it as a desktop calculator.

The hp-34 was the Hewlett-Packard’s first pocket calculator and the world’s first
scientific pocket calculator. A calculator with Trigonometric & Exponential
functions. It was introduced in 1972

The SR-50 was Texas instruments first scientific pocket calculator with
Trigonometric & Logarithmic functions. It was introduced in 1974.

Casio is a major player in the graphing calculator market. It was introduced in

    Notable features are its ability to graph functions and that it is
    programmable.

DEFINING PRODUCT:

The advanced scientific calculator performs various operations ranging from
calculating the sum, difference, product, division, bitwise or, bitwise and & xor of
two numbers to calculating the factorial, power, square root, sine, cosine, tan,

logarithmic values of a given number. It is equipped with a special feature to
calculate the sum of all numbers till the given input number and also calculate the
factorial of a given number.

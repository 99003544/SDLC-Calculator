**Project name: - Scientific Calculator**

**Requirement Analysis**

- **High Level Requirements**
  - Any calculator needs to have the highest speed and accuracy.
  - The system should be multifunctional.
  - The System should be user friendly and compact.
  - The smart calculator&#39;s battery lifetime should be more.
  - The precision value should be high.

- **Low Level Requirements**

- The speed of the calculator, it should give output within seconds.
- The system functions need to be specified and work properly.
- The precision of the calculator should be more.
- The functions taking take input and process the output within nanoseconds.
